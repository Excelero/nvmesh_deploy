Scope: Deploy NVMesh to management, target, and client nodes.

Management pre-reqs:
	+ eval OS version (pre-flight, no auto-remediation)
	+ eval kernel version (pre-flight, no auto-remediation)

mongodb
	+ add repo
	+ install packages
	+ configure 
		+ fw port: tcp 27017
			+ in from mgmt subnet? explicit hosts?
			+ out to mgmt subnet? explicit hosts?
		+ bindIP
		? cacheSizeGB
	+ enable / start service
	+ conditional 
		+ availability via replica set
			+ test number of nodes
			+ configure rs to include nodes
	+ advanced / unscoped
		+ access control
		+ configure authenticated access

node.js
	+ add repo
	+ install packages

Management deploy:
	+ add Excelero repo
		+ credentials
	+ install nvmesh-management and -utils
	+ configure management.js.conf
		+ https
		+ mongod connections
			+ include statistics and metadata connections, as well as base
			+ conditional
				+ single or HA with replica set, as required
	+ configure fw ports: tcp: 4000, 4001 and (maybe conditional?) tcp: 4002, 4003, 4004, 4005, 4006 for statistics
	+ enable / start service
	+ optional 
		+ SMTP
	+ advanced / unscoped
		+ import certificate for SSL
		+ configure mongod auth (user/password/db)
		+ non-default statistics
		+ non-default backup
		+ enable zoning
		+ containerized
		+ remediate kernel

Potential Post-Install of management:
	+ (API) create non-default Admin user
	+ optional
		+ create Observer user(s)


Client / Target pre-reqs:
	+ eval OS version (pre-flight, no auto-remediation)
	+ eval kernel version (pre-flight, no auto-remediation)
	+ conditional 
		+ eval MOFED version, if required (pre-flight, no auto-remediation)
	+ advanced / unscoped:
		+ remediate kernel
		+ install / remediate MOFED

Client / Target common deploy:
	+ conditional
		+ add excelero repo (if node not also management node)
	+ install nvmesh-utils and nvmesh-core (let package manager skip -utils if already present, for simplicity)
	+ sysctl parameters as per nvmesh_health_check -- as /etc/sysctl.d/50-ipv4-arp.conf
	+ nvmesh.conf
		+ configure MANAGEMENT_SERVERS based on as-built above
		+ https
		+ conditional
			+ configure CONFIGURED_NICS if subset	
			+ TCP Enabled? (+ IPv4_ONLY) v. RDMA v. both

Client-specific deploy:
	+ optional
		+ NVMF_IP
	+ configure fw ports: tcp 4001 
	+ enable / start service

Target-specific deploy:
	+ conditional 
		+ Excluded Drives
		+ RDDA
	+ configure fw ports: tcp 4001, udp 4791
	+ enable / start service
	+ advanced / unscoped
		+ MAX_CLIENT_RSRC 

Potential Post-Install of Targets:
	+ populate API user & hashed password in ~/.nvmesh_cli_files/nvmesh_api_secrets
	+ format drives

Other unscoped:
	+ Volumes
	+ Classes
	+ Custom VPGs
	+ Security Groups
	+ Keys
	+ Configuration Profiles
